These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag
tBodyAccJerkMag
tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

angle(): Angle between two vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean


Feature Vector variables:
=========================

mean() : 		mean values of multiple measurements of the 				original variables.
			Type: Real number
		
std(): 		Standard deviation of multiple measurements 				of the original variables.
			Type: Real number

activity_id: 	Identifier, identifying the activity of each 				subject
			Type: 	Integer
			Values: 	1 : 6

activity_name: 	Descriptive name of each subject's activity
			Type: 	Factor
			Values: 	WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, 								WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, 					LAYING

subject_id :	Identifier, identifying each subject
			Type: 	Integer
			Values: 	1 : 30
