# Gettingandcleaningdata

 The goal of this project is to facilitate and automate the process of tidying data available below. This project includes a script that reads the Raw data set, transforms the data and creates a tidy data set
 
- Download Raw data set and unzip it into your R working directory
- Download run_analysis.R script into your R working directory
- Loads both the training and test datasets, keeping only those columns which reflect a mean or standard deviation
-Converts the activity and subject columns into factors
- Creates a tidy dataset that consists of the average (mean) value of each variable for each subject and activity pair.
- Source/Execute the script and wait until tidy data is generated. 
-  The two data sets will be stored in .tidyTxt/ directory as well as these will be available in your R workspace.
