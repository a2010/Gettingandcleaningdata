-# Proceeding with script
- Download Raw data set and unzip it into your R working directory
- Download run_analysis.R script into your R working directory
- Source/Execute the script and wait until Tidy data is generated. This may take up to several minutes.
- The two data sets will be stored in .TidyData/ directory as well as these will be available in your R workspace.
